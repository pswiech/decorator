Decorator Design Pattern

Dynamically adds responsibility to the interface by wrapping the original code
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern

Examples:
- car showroom

Decorator (recognizeable by creational methods taking an instance of same abstract/interface type which adds additional behaviour)

- All subclasses of java.io.InputStream, OutputStream, Reader and Writer have a constructor taking an instance of same type.

- java.util.Collections, the checkedXXX(), synchronizedXXX() and unmodifiableXXX() methods.

- javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper and HttpServletResponseWrapper
